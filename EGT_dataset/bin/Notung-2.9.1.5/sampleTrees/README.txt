speciestree_mega: 
 
  Species tree containing a selection of bacterial, plant, fungal 
  and animal species.  Species are specified by SWISSPROT tax-id's 
  (http://autodep.ebi.ac.uk/speclist.txt).  This tree is 
  provided for demonstration purposes.  While we have endeavored to 
  represent species relationships correctly, we are not 
  systematists and cannot guarantee the accuracy of this tree. 
  Anyone using this tree for scientific analysis should verify the 
  species relationships before proceeding.
