  - Instructions on how to run the Notung GUI are given in Chapter 3,
    Getting Started.

  - Instructions for the homology classification functions are given
    in Section 5.6 Inferring Orthologs, Paralogs, and Xenologs.

  - Phylogenomic analysis is a batch processing option.  The
    --phylogenomics option and its new averaging feature are described
    in Section 12.4, Running a phylogenomic analysis.

sampleTrees

  This directory contains gene and species trees in Newick format that
  exemplify various Notung functions.  The trees used in the Worked
  Examples in Appendix E are provided in this directory.

  A subdirectory, xenologTrees, contains the trees used in Figures in
  the article cited above.

batchExamples

  This directory contains test data that exemplifies the use of
  Notung's batch processing functions via the command line interface.
